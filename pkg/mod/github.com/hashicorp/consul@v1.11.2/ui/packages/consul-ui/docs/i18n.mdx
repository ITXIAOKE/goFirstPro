At the time of writing we are currently in the process of
localizing/internationalizing the entire codebase. To help us to do this we
use the [`ember-intl`](https://github.com/ember-intl/ember-intl) ember addon

Please see [`ember-intl`s documentation](https://ember-intl.github.io/ember-intl/versions/master/docs/quickstart)
for information on how to use this.

Additionally we have several dev-time only cookie/environment variables to
help engineers see what still requires localizing, to test copy/text using
localizations other than en-us and to view any required interpolation
variables with rendered text, instead of doing the actual interpolation
itself.

| Link/Bookmarklet | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [Enable Intl Debug](javascript:Scenario('CONSUL_INTL_DEBUG=1')) | Render intl interpolation variable names instead of interpolating them |
| [Intl Lorem Ipsum](javascript:Scenario('CONSUL_INTL_LOCALE=la-fk')) | Render all intl copy as lorem ipsum |
| [Intl Dashes](javascript:Scenario('CONSUL_INTL_LOCALE=-')) | Render all intl copy as `-` |

## en-us

If in doubt, or unless specifically directed otherwise, all text should use
sentence case, apart from 'Consul Nouns' which should use capital casing.
'Consul Nouns' here would be things like 'Services', 'Ingress Gateways', 'Nodes'
and other things that are specific 'objects' in Consul. We also use the form
'ACLs' for acronyms instead of 'Acls'.

```yaml
text: Viewing metrics for Ingress Gateways is not currently supported
text: ACLs are disabled
```

instead of:

```yaml
text: Viewing Metrics for ingress gateways is not currently supported
text: Acls are disabled
```
